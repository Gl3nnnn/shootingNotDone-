This directory is intended to hold local audio files for the shooting game.

Please add the following audio files here:
- bg-music.mp3 : Background music loop
- shoot-sound.mp3 : Shooting sound effect
- hit-sound.mp3 : Hit sound effect
- powerup-sound.mp3 : Powerup sound effect

You can download free audio files from sites like freesound.org or freesfx.co.uk, or use your own audio files.

Once the files are added, I will update the project to use these local audio files.
